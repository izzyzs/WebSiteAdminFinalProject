### Web Site Administration Final Project

* I've decided to make a to-do list as my final project for this class.

* It will include the following HTML pages:
	- home.html: displays all tasks with buttons for adding, editing, or deleting
	- add_task.html: allows user to add task (Form)
	- edit_task.html: allows user to edit task (Form)
