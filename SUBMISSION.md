-   I did this solo

## **Functionality**

There are three main HTML pages:

-   add_task.html
-   edit_task.html
-   home.html

add_task has a form with 2 fields (for title and description) and a submit button
add_task has a form with 3 fields (for the 2 from add_task and a checkbox for completed) and a submit button
home displays all the tasks and give the user an option to edit or delete every Task

## **Database Design**

-   There is one simple table: a **Task** table
-   The **Task** has multiple fields and they are
    1. Title (a text value)
    2. Description (a text value)
    3. Completed (a boolean value; true or false)
    4. Created_at (time)
    5. Updated_at (time)
